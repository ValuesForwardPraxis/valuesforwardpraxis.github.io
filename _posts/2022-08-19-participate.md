_Values-Forward Praxis: Data Science, Machine Learning, & AI in Cultural Heritage Organizations_ will be a CLIR “Pocket Burgundy” book that supports responsible operational use of data science, machine learning, and AI in libraries, archives, and museums. To facilitate that goal, we are in the process of interviewing professionals working in libraries, archives, and museums, for their thoughts, opinions, and experiences related to using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cultural heritage sector.

While [our research team](https://valuesforwardpraxis.github.io/) includes scholars and practitioners with a good sense of this field, we also recognize that much important work is likely happening outside our collective purview. To that end, we are happy to accept nominations, including self nominations, for individuals, teams, or projects we should seek to include in our interviews. If you can tell us a little bit about how their work intersects with the aims of this project, that will help us evaluate the recommendation.

To nominate someone (or yourself!) for inclusion in our research, please [complete this brief form](https://forms.gle/weYoQkvhkrjHmvm3A). Interviews are 30-60 minutes in length. Interviews are not recorded or published, but major themes or ideas will be cited in the VFP book.

**Important Note**: Completing this form does not commit anyone to participating in our project; it simply suggests that we should consider reaching out to someone. We will evaluate all nominations based on the criteria we use for compiling our interview list and may invite those nominated. Anyone we invite may accept or decline our invitation to participate.
